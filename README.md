### Custom Sass File

The `.scss` file that can be found in the `assets` folder have some gradients & other styles. They can be deleted or updated.

#### Yup & Vee-Validate

I will definitely be switching to vee-validate for dealing with forms.

#### Icons

The public folder contains a `favicon` & `icon`. Change these out for your app and be sure to tweak the pwa config inside the `nuxt.config` file to fit your app
